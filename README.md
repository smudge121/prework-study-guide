# Prework Study Guide WebPage

## Description

I created a simple webpage that will serve as a not taking sheet for future studying needs. 
I learned basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to format, color, and add functionality to the webpage.
    For example, the webpage will give the user a suggested topic of study.
Overall, this webpage serves as a base level note taking sheet to be built upon.
